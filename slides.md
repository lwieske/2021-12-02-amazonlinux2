## Amazon Linux 2

* Amazon Linux 2 is a server operating system from Amazon Web Services (AWS).

* AL2 long-term support includes security updates and bug fixes for 5 years.

* AL2 is provided without charge as an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for EC2.

* AL2 is available as container/virtual images downloads for free as well.

* These images can be used for on-premises development and testing.

---

## AL2 - Software

* Extras in AL2 provide bleeding edge software on a stable base of AL2.

* AL2 packages and configurations provide tight integration with AWS services.

* AL2 comes among others with many AWS tools (e.g. AWS CLI) and cloud-init.

* AL2 includes the widely adopted systemd init system - (was upstart before).

* AL2 includes a LTS Kernel tuned for enhanced performance on Amazon EC2.

---

## AL2 - Security

* AL2 limits remote access by using SSH key pairs and by disabling remote root login.

* AL2 reduces the number of non-critical packages which are installed on an instance.

* So, it limits exposure to potential security vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

* Security updates rated critical/important are automatically applied on initial boot.

* AL2 allows for kernel live patching (kernel patches without reboot or downtime).

---

## AL2 - Roots and History

* AL2 started off as a RHEL/CentOS modification.
  
* It has changed enough that you can probably call it a separate distro now.
  
* AL2 hasn't been compatible with RHEL/CentOS anything in quite a while.
  
* Blogs and forums show hundreds of issues wrt packages on RHEL/CentOS vs AL2 .

* Using *uname -a* returns

  * kernel "amzn1" - centos6
  
  * kernel "amzn2" - centos7

## CentOS Stream Announcement

* IBM/RedHat announced that the future of the CentOS Project is CentOS Stream on Tuesday, 8th December 2020.

* On Tuesday, 16th November 2021, CentOS Linux 8, as a rebuild of RHEL 8, announced GA of its latest version.

* CentOS Linux 8 will EOL on 31 December 2021 and will handle it as directed by the CentOS Project Board of Directors.
  
* CentOS Stream continues after that date, serving as the upstream (development) branch of RedHat Enterprise Linux.

---

## CentOS Alternatives

* Current alternatives are:

  * AlmaLinux
  * CentOS Stream
  * Oracle Linux
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) mit einem Developer Account kostenlos nutzen
  * Rocky Linux

* RHEL offers a free Developer Account meanwhile.

---

## AlmaLinux

* AlmaLinux is built and maintained by the developers at CloudLinux.

* CloudLinux traditionally provides server hosting and Linux software.

* AlmaLinux offers AMD64/ARM64 builds and a special image for Raspberry Pi.

---

## RockyLinux

* Rocky Linux is headed up by Gregory Kurtzer, the original founder of CentOS.
  
* The Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation (RESF) is a Public Benefit
  Corporation (PBC) formed in Delaware (file number 4429978). The RESF was
  founded and is owned by Gregory Kurtzer and is backed by an advisory board of
  trusted individuals and team leads from the Rocky Linux community.

* Rocky Linux claims to be 100% bug-for-bug compatible with America's top distro.

* RockyLinux functions as a downstream build as CentOS had done previously.

* RockyLinux builds releases after - not before - they have been added upstream.

---

## Amazon Linux Extras

* Extras enables the consumption of new versions of application and supporting software.

## Amazon Linux 2 on and for AWS ECS/EKS/Lambda

* Amazon Linux 2 is not only available in EC2 but embedded in other services as well.

  * IaaS with EC2 ...
  * CaaS with ECS ...
  * KaaS with EKS ...
  * FaaS with Lambda

* IaaS requires you to manage software at machine level.

* CaaS (Containers-as-a-Service) lets you abstract away the complexity of single
  machine configurations by sharing them among multiple services. Youâ€™re still
  required to keep your base container images up-to-date.

---

## Amazon Linux 2 on and for AWS ECS/EKS/Lambda (II)

* KaaS (Kubernetes-as-aService) lets you abstract away the complexity of single
  container configuration by giving you abstractions for entire microservice
  architectures. The Cloud Native Landscape gives you an overview on
  technologies involved. Kubernetes can happen to be a crystallization germ for
  the emergence of an ecosystem of evolutions around culture, people,
  organisation and technology.

* FaaS (Functions-as-a-Service) lets you abstract away the complexity of single
  container lifecycles by giving you abstractions for chaining events and
  invocations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation gives you an overview on
  the evolving ecosystem of FaaS and/or Serverless as others might call it.
